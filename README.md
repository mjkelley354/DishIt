# Dish It
Dish It is a new app for epicureans with an eye toward finding the perfect dish.  Rather than relying on restaurant searches by cuisine, Dish It allows you to search for specific dishes and filter by given taste profiles.  We've all been to a restaurant that might not be fantastic but they've somehow managed to find the special sauce to make one thing REALLY GOOD!  This is what DIsh It is all about.

## What's a Dish? 
Hey it isn't complicated - a dish is a dish:  Cheese Pizza, Bacon Cheeseburger, Lasagna are the sorts of things you can search by.  Dish it will return results for those kinds of things with ratings based on the given dish not just the restaurant.

## Filtering
Some times you might have a specific flavor profile in mind... something salty, something sweet, etc.  This is where Dish it Filtering comes in, to narrow you results to meet just what your taste buds desire!

## Map
We all get lost occasionally, Map It shows you the dining Mecca you desire.

## Ratings 
You're the boss - as a Dish It user, you can add your own dishes, restaurants and ratings to share you dining experiences with others.  Just click on the Add It page to tell the world about your latest dining adventure.
